reminders:
  
- make sure your Github lab repository is public to be able to import into Replit
- to install pytest: ```python3 -m pip install pytest```
- to import files and packages: ```python -m pip install -e .```
- to run main.py: ```python3 main.py```
- for individual tests: ```python3 -m pytest tests/test.py -k test_name_of_function```
- for all tests: ```python3 -m pytest tests/test.py```
- use [Python Tutor](https://pythontutor.com/composingprograms.html#mode=display) if you are having trouble drawing/figuring out the environment diagrams
- refer to lab00 setup description for help
- everything is run in Shell, not Console!
